# Project FFB4 — Overview

## What this project is

A **minimal fantasy football player database** built with Next.js and Supabase. It stores NFL skill-position players (QB, RB, WR, TE), links them to draft history, imports yearly fantasy stats from nflverse, and displays career rankings in a simple web UI.

## Why FFB4 exists

FFB3 proved the core data pipeline and UI worked well. It became hard to maintain once we added **player valuation and career projections** — that work grew quickly, was hard to test, and the repo history became difficult to follow.

FFB4 is a **clean restart** that keeps only what worked:

| Included (working) | Excluded (deferred) |
|---|---|
| Supabase schema for players, drafts, season stats | Player valuation / PAB tiers |
| nflverse import pipeline | Career projection models |
| Career stats refresh function | Dynasty calibration |
| Homepage + player rankings + detail pages | Backtest / ablation scripts |

We will revisit predictions later, on a solid foundation, with design docs and version control from day one.
